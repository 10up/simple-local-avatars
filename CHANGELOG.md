# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file, per [the Keep a Changelog standard](http://keepachangelog.com/).

## [2.1.1] - 2019-05-07
* Fixed: Do not delete avatars just because they don't exist on the local filesystem. This was occasionally dumping avatars when WordPress uploads were stored elsewhere, e.g. a cloud service.

## [2.1] - 2018-10-24
### Added
* All avatar uploads now go into the media library. Don't worry - users without the ability to upload files cannot otherwise see the contents of your media library. This allows local avatars to respect other functionality your site may have around uploaded images, such as external hosting.
* REST API support for getting and updating.
* Use .org language packs rather than bundling translations.
### Fixed
* Avoid an `ArgumentCountError`.
* A couple of internationalization issues.

## [2.0] - 2013-06-02
### Added
* Choose or upload an avatar from the media library (for users with appropriate capabilities)!
* Local avatars are rated for appropriateness, just like Gravatar
* A new setting under Discussion enables administrators to turn off Gravatar (only use local avatars)
* Delete the local avatar with a single button click (like everywhere else in WordPress)
* Uploaded avatar file names are appended with the timestamp, addressing browser image caching issues
* New developer filter for preventing automatic rescaling: simple_local_avatars_dynamic_resize
* New developer filter for limiting upload size: simple_local_avatars_upload_limit
* Upgraded functions deprecated since WordPress 3.5
* Hungarian translation added (needs further updating again with new version)
### Fixed
* Fixed translations not working on front end (although translations are now a bit out of date...)
* Assorted refactoring / improvements under the hood

## [1.3.1] - 2011-12-29
### Added
* Brazilian Portuguese and Belarusian translations
