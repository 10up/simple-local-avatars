Adds an avatar upload field to user profiles. Generates requested sizes on demand just like Gravatar!

== Description ==

Adds an avatar upload field to user profiles if the current user has media permissions. Generates requested sizes on demand just like Gravatar! Simple and lightweight.

Just edit a user profile, and scroll down to the new "Avatar" field. The plug-in will take care of cropping and sizing!

1. Stores avatars in the "uploads" folder where all of your other media is kept
1. Has a simple, native interface
1. Fully supports Gravatar and default avatars if no local avatar is set for the user - but also allows you turn off Gravatar
1. Generates the requested avatar size on demand (and stores the new size for efficiency), so it looks great, just like Gravatar!
1. Let's you decide whether lower privilege users (subscribers, contributors) can upload their own avatar
1. Enables rating of local avatars, just like Gravatar

== Installation ==

1. Install easily with the WordPress plugin control panel or manually download the plugin and upload the extracted folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. If you only want users with file upload capabilities to upload avatars, check the applicable option under Settings > Discussion
1. Start uploading avatars by editing user profiles!

Use avatars in your theme using WordPress' built in `get_avatar()` function: [http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_avatar](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_avatar "get_avatar function")

You can also use `get_simple_local_avatar()` (with the same arguments) to retreive local avatars a bit faster, but this will make your theme dependent on this plug-in.

= 2.1 =
* *New:* All avatar uploads now go into the media library. Don't worry - users without the ability to upload files cannot otherwise see the contents of your media library. This allows local avatars to respect other functionality your site may have around uploaded images, such as external hosting.
* *New:* REST API support for getting and updating.
* *New:* Use .org language packs rather than bundling translations.
* *Fixed:* Avoid an `ArgumentCountError`.
